# Simple If Conditions
One of the single most important statements in every programming language is the `if` statement. 

In programming we often **check particular conditions** and perform various actions depending on the result of the check. 

This is done by `if` condition, which has the following structure:
```csharp
if (condition) 
{
  // condition body;
}
```
