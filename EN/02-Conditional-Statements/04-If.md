# If Statement
One of the single most important statements in every programming language is the `if` statement. 

An `if` statement identifies which statement to run based on the value of a `Boolean` expression. 

In the following example, the bool variable condition is set to `true` and then checked in the `if` statement.

The if statement needs a boolean result, that is, `true` or `false`
  * If the boolean result is true take action

```csharp
if (condition) 
{
  // Code for execution if the condition is true
}
```
