# Statements
The **actions** that a program takes, are expressed as **statements**. 
C# supports several different kinds of statements and here are a few of them:
  * **Declaration statements** - declare local variables and constants
  * **Expression statements** - evaluate expressions
  * **Selection statements** - select one of a number of possible statements
  * **Iteration statements** - execute repeatedly an embedded statement
  * **Jump statements** - transfer control
  
Common actions include:

  **Declaring** a variable
  ```csharp
  int counter;
  ```

  **Assigning** a value
  ```csharp
  counter = 1;
  ```

  Declaring + **initializing**
  ```csharp
  int counter = 1;
  ```

  **Printing** a value
  ```csharp
  Console.WriteLine(counter);
  ```

  **Modifying** a value
  ```csharp
  counter++;
  ```
  
  ```csharp
  sum = a + b;
  ```
