# Data Types
In C# we can use data types to define variables as follows:
  * **int** – an integer number: 1, 2, 3…
  * **double** – a floating-point: -0.5, 3.14, …
  * **bool** – a Boolean value: true, false
  * **char** – a symbol: 'a', 'b', '#', …
  * **string** – text: "Hello", "World", …

Once a variable is defined, it can change its value many times, but it cannot change its data type later. 

Variables may hold only data of their type. Here is how we can declare variables of different types:
```csharp
int a = 5;
string text = "Some text";
char letter = 'A';
float f = 4.2;
```

Data types set ranges of values with similar characteristics.

The are characterized by:
  * Name - E.g. bool, int, string, DateTime
  * Size (memory usage) - Example: 4 bytes
  * Default value - Example: 0

# Naming Conventions
In computer programming, a naming convention is a set of rules for choosing the name to be used for variables.

In C# the convention for naming variables are used ***"camel-case"***. There are other naming conventions which are used in different languages such as pascal case, snake case. 

**Camel case** combines words by capitalizing all words following the first word and removing the space, as follows:

```csharp
int userLoginCount;
```

**Pascal case** combines words by capitalizing each word along with the first one as it follows:
```csharp
int UserLoginCount;
```

**Snake-case** is another naming convention, which separates words with one underscore character (_) and no spaces, with each element's initial letter usually lowercased within the compound and the first letter either upper or lowercase as it follows:
```csharp
int users_count;
string first_name;
```
