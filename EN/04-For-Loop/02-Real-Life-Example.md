# Real-Life Example: Moving Dishes
You know exactly how many dishes you are going to move from the sink to the dishwasher before you start this task, because there is a certain number of dirty dishes in the sink.

You won't stop loading the dishwasher until you've completed that task for all dirty dishes.

So, you'll pick up the first one and put it in the dishwasher - that's one item.

Then you'll pick up the second one and put it in the dishwasher and continue repeating same action until you put all dirty dishes in the dishwasher.
