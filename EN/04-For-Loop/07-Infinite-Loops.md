# Infinite Loops
So far, we were introduced to `for` loop, learning what structure has and how is applied. 

Now, we need to understand what an **infinite loop** is and when it occurs.

We call an **infinite loop** one that **repeats infinitely** the performance of its body. 

Infinite `for` occurs when there is **no condition to end the loop**.

Here is what a `for` loop with no end condition looks like:
```cs
for ( ; ; ) 
{
  Console.WriteLine("Hello World");
}
```
