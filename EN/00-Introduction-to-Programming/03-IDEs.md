# Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
Integrated Development Environments (**IDE**) simplify software development:
 * IDEs save time and eases the process of coding
 * Writing, running, testing, and debugging the code
 * For programming in C#, we use **Visual Studio**

They are actually editors for programs, in which we write the program code and we can compile it and run it to see the errors, fix them and start the program again.

To write programs, we need an IDE and the recommended ones for C# are:

* Visual Studio (for Windows)
* Visual Studio / Raider (for macOS)
* Visual Studio Code / Raider (for Linux)

For **Java** -> IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans.

For **Python** -> PyCharm / Eclipse / VS Code.

For **C#** -> Visual Studio / Raider / VS Code.
