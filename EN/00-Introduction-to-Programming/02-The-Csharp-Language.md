# Programming Languages
A programming language is an artificial language (syntax for expression), meant for giving commands that we want the computer to read, process and execute.

Using programming languages, we write sequences of commands (programs), which define 
what the computer should do. 

Examples of programming languages are C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, PHP, Swift, Go and many others. 

These languages differ in their philosophy, syntax, purpose, programming constructions and execution environment. 

The execution of computer programs can be done with a compiler or with an interpreter.

# Compilers
The compiler translates the code from programming language to machine code, as for each of the constructions (commands) in the code it chooses a proper, previously prepared fragment of machine code and in the meantime it checks the text of the program for errors. 

Together, the compiled fragments comprise the program into a machine code, as the microprocessor of the 
computer expects it.

# Interpreters
The interpreter is "a program for executing programs", written in some programming language. 

It executes the commands in the program one after another, as it understands not only a single command and sequences of commands, but also other language constructions.

# The C# Language
**C#** is modern, general purpose programming language

* It is used for creating web apps, mobile apps, games, back-end apps
* It is object oriented
* C# programs consist of **classes**, which hold **methods**

Good choice for beginners

* Easy syntax, easy to read, **easy to learn**
* Big developer **community**, many jobs
* Lots of **resources**: books, lessons, courses

# C# Compilation and Execution
C# is a **high-level language**, which is **compiled**, which means that we write commands that are being compiled before they're being executed. 

A program in C# is written in text format (**source code**). 

The result of execution is called an executable file (**prog.exe**) C# uses a handful of tools, provided by 
the **.NET Core**

# .NET Runtime Environment 
It represents a virtual machine, something like a computer in the computer, which can run a compiled C# code. 

The language C# is compiled into an intermediary .NET code and is executed from the .NET environment, which compiles this intermediary code additionally into machine instructions (machine code) in order to be executed
by the microprocessor. 

.NET environment contains libraries with classes, CSC compiler, CLR (Common Language Runtime â€“ CLR) and other components, which are required for working with the language C# and run C# programs.
