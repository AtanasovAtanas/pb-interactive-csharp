# Programming Languages
A programming language is an artificial language (syntax for expression), meant for giving commands that we want the computer to **read**, **process** and **execute**.

Using programming languages, we write **sequences of commands** (programs), which define what the computer should do. 

Examples of programming languages are C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, C, C++, PHP, Swift, Go and many others. 

These languages differ in their philosophy, syntax, purpose, programming constructions and execution environment. 

The execution of computer programs can be done with a **compiler** or with an **interpreter**.

# Compilers
The **compiler** translates the code from programming language to **machine code**, as for each of the constructions (commands) in the code it chooses a proper, previously prepared fragment of machine code and in the meantime it **checks** the text of the program for **errors**. 

Together, the compiled fragments comprise the program into a machine code, as the microprocessor of the computer expects it.

# Interpreters
The **interpreter** is "a **program for executing programs**", written in some programming language. 

It executes the commands in the program **one after another**, as it understands not only a single command and sequences of commands, but also other language constructions.

# The C# Language
**C#** is modern, general purpose programming language. 

Extremely versatile. You can create everything: from desktop and mobile applications to web applications, online services and back-end functionality. 

The demand for C# / .NET Core developers is currently among the highest because of the technical level and openness of the platform. This ensures professional realization once you have the skills you need! C# and .NET Core are used by about **2,000,000** programmers around the world (according to Microsoft). 

Right now C# is one of the most suitable programming languages for **beginners**. 
* It is easy to learn C# through the rich set of video tutorials and exercises at **SoftUni**. 

Combines **procedural**, **object-oriented** and **functional programming** with a **clear and concise syntax**.

# C# Compilation and Execution
As we have already mentioned, a program is **a sequence of commands**, otherwise said, it describes a sequence of calculations, evaluations, iterations and all kinds of similar operations, which aim to obtain certain result.

A C# program is written in a text format, and the text of the program is called a **source code**. 

It gets compiled into an **executable file** (for example `Program.cs` gets compiled to `Program.exe`) or it is **executed directly** from the .NET environment.

The process of **compilation** of the code before its execution is used only in compiled languages like C#, Java and C++. 

With **scripts and interpreted languages**, like JavaScript, Python and PHP, the source code gets executed step by step by an interpreter

# .NET Runtime Environment 
**.NET Runtime Environment** represents a virtual machine, something like a computer in the computer, which can run a compiled C# code. 

With the risk of going too deep into details, we have to explain that the language C# is compiled into an intermediary .NET code and is executed from the .NET environment, which compiles this intermediary code additionally into machine instructions (machine code) in order to be executed by the microprocessor. 

.NET environment contains libraries with classes, **CSC** compiler, **CLR** (Common Language Runtime â€“ CLR) and other components, which are required for working with the language C# and run C# programs.

**The .NET environment** is available as a free software with open source code for every modern operating system (like Windows, Linux and Mac OS X). It has two variations, **.NET Framework** (the older one) and **.NET Core** (the newer one), but none of that is essential when it comes to getting into programming. Let us focus on writing programs with the C# language.
